A simple interface for quick calculation of Gaussian beam properties and other laser related utilities.

It provides calculators:
1. Gaussian beam propagation in free space.
2. Focusing size of a collimated Gaussian beam.
3. Pulsed laser power (avg and peak) from pulse energy.

It provides converters:
1. dB to %.
2. dBm to W.
